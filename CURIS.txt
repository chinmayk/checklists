Matching with a CURIS student:
- encourage fellow PhD students to submit CURIS project descriptions
(and submit your own)
- interview CURIS candidates (15 minutes is usually enough time)
- choose your best candidate (you and the student should pick highest
priority for the CURIS matching algorithm)
- after you are matched with a student, get them to commit by email
(have them send a photo and post it on the HCI website)
- arrange a time to meet during spring quarter to plan for the summer
>
Pre-summer preparation:
- compile a list of all participating CURIS and PhD students
- encourage fellow PhD students to outline detailed plans for the
summer (and do the same for your own projects)
- schedule a date for a CURIS kickoff event (best if this occurs
within the first week of summer)
- email your own CURIS students and setup a time/place to start their
internships.
- organize the kickoff event (Options:  BBQ on the AT&T patio, picnic
at a local park, mini-golf outing, etc.)
>
During the summer:
- day one: meet your students, describe the high-level research goals,
and then work collaboratively on a summer plan (NOTE: you should
already have a plan, but working on this with student will help them
take ownership. For better transparency, have the students produce a
poster-sized calendar and hang it in their work area.)
- have all CURIS students write down a few notes about what they hope to get out of CURIS.
- day two: get your students to setup shared calendars and docs, svn
repositories, etc as necessary for your project
- be there everyday. (Tip:  Meet your students from 10-11a each
morning and make a plan for that day.)
>
Towards the end of summer
- schedule an August Weds lunch for students to present their projects
- help students with their CURIS posters and attend the event
- persuade Scott to have an end-of-summer party at his house
