#Checklists for research activities.

Feel free to contribute your own. 

This README should enventually contain guidelines for what makes a good checklist, but here's a start

* Specific to a task (e.g. submitting to a conference, NOT "doing research")
* Short (no more than ~5 items)
* Should not include steps which are never missed (e.g. "submit the paper")
* Assume the reader knows what is to be done. The checklist is a reminder, not a manual.
